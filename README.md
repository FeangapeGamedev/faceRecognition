Face Detection Web App
This is a full-stack face detection application that uses the Clarifai API to identify faces in images. The frontend is built using React and hosted separately from the backend, which is deployed on Render.

The project was developed as a hands-on learning experience to cover key areas of full-stack development, including frontend, backend, and database integration.

Overview
Users can input image URLs to detect faces.

Detected faces are highlighted using bounding boxes.

Includes user authentication and entry tracking.

Backend securely communicates with the Clarifai API.

User data and image submission count are stored in a PostgreSQL database.
