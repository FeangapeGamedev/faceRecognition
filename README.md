# Face Detection Web App

This is a full-stack face detection application that uses the Clarifai API to identify faces in images. The frontend is built using React and hosted separately from the backend, which is deployed on Render.

The project was developed as a hands-on learning experience to cover key areas of full-stack development, including frontend, backend, and database integration.
